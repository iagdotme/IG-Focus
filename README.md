# IG Focus - Instagram Feed Reader & Media Archiver

A Python-based tool to access, archive, and download content from your Instagram feed using [instagrapi](https://github.com/subzeroid/instagrapi).

## Features

### Archive & Download
- Full 2FA (two-factor authentication) support
- Session reuse - no repeated logins
- Download photos, videos, and albums
- Fetch post comments and engagement data
- Extract comprehensive metadata
- Human-readable timestamps
- Organized JSON output with timestamps

### Web Viewer üé® NEW!
- Beautiful Instagram-like web interface
- View downloaded feeds offline in your browser
- No server required - pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Fully accessible with keyboard navigation
- Filter by type, search by content
- Lightbox for full-size media viewing
- See [viewer/README.md](viewer/README.md) for details

## Setup

1. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **First-time authentication:**
   ```bash
   python login_with_2fa.py
   ```
   Enter your 6-digit 2FA code when prompted. This creates a `session.json` file for future logins.

## Quick Start

### Option 4: Simple Example (No 2FA)

Edit `simple_example.py` and replace the credentials:

```python
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
```

Then run:

```bash
python simple_example.py
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This script doesn't support 2FA. Use Option 1 or 2 if you have 2FA enabled.

## What You Can Access

The scripts retrieve posts from your Instagram feed (timeline) including:

- **Post Information:**
  - Post ID
  - Username of poster
  - Caption text
  - Like count
  - Comment count
  - Post timestamp
  - Media type (photo, video, album)

- **Media URLs:**
  - Thumbnail URLs
  - Video URLs (if applicable)

## Output

### JSON Files
Each run creates a timestamped JSON file:
- Format: `feed_enhanced_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
- Contains: All post metadata, comments, URLs, timestamps
- Location: Project root directory

### Downloaded Media
If media download is enabled:
- Location: `downloads/` folder
- Naming: `username_postid.jpg` or `username_postid.mp4`
- Organized by post for easy reference

## Security Notes

ÔøΩ **Important:**
- Never commit your credentials to version control
- The `session.json` file contains sensitive login data - keep it secure
- Consider using environment variables for credentials in production

## API Capabilities

Using instagrapi, you can also:
- Get user information
- Download photos and videos
- Like/unlike posts
- Comment on posts
- Get followers/following lists
- Search for users and hashtags
- Access stories
- And much more!

See the [instagrapi documentation](https://subzeroid.github.io/instagrapi/) for full API reference.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

If your account has 2FA enabled (recommended for security), the scripts will:

1. Detect that 2FA is required
2. Prompt you to enter the 6-digit verification code
3. Accept the code from your:
   - Authentication app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
   - SMS message
   - Email

**First Login with 2FA:**
```bash
python login_with_2fa.py
# or
python feed_reader.py
```

When prompted, enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app.

**Subsequent Logins:**
Once you've logged in successfully, a `session.json` file is created. Future logins will:
- Use the saved session (no 2FA needed)
- Only ask for 2FA if the session expires

## Troubleshooting

**"Two-factor authentication required" Error:**
- ‚úÖ **Solution:** Scripts now support 2FA! Just run them and enter your verification code when prompted.
- The code will be sent to your authentication app or phone
- Enter the 6-digit code when asked

**Login Issues:**
- Make sure you're entering the correct username (not email)
- Check that your password is correct
- If session is corrupted, delete `session.json` and login fresh
- Instagram may temporarily block login attempts if you try too many times

**Rate Limiting:**
- Instagram limits API requests
- Wait a few minutes between large requests
- Don't fetch too many posts at once

**Session Expired:**
- If you see errors about expired sessions, delete `session.json`
- Run the script again to create a fresh session
