## Viewing Local Media Files

The viewer can display downloaded media files from your `downloads/` folder. However, browsers have security restrictions on loading local files.

### Option 1: Simple (URLs Only)
Just open `index.html` in your browser. The viewer will display:
- Online URLs from Instagram (if available in JSON)
- Limited local file support depending on browser

### Option 2: Local Web Server (Recommended)
For full local media support, run a simple web server:

**Using Python 3:**
```bash
# From the ig/ directory (parent of viewer/)
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open: `http://localhost:8000/viewer/`

**Using Node.js:**
```bash
# Install if needed
npm install -g http-server

# From the ig/ directory
http-server -p 8000
```

Then open: `http://localhost:8000/viewer/`

**Why use a server?**
- Loads local images/videos from `downloads/` folder
- No CORS or file:// protocol restrictions
- Full functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading
1. Make sure you're using a local web server (see above)
2. Check that `downloads/` folder is in the parent directory of `viewer/`
3. Verify image filenames match those in the JSON file
4. The viewer will automatically fall back to Instagram URLs if local files fail

### Avatar Images Not Showing
- **This is normal!** Instagram's CDN blocks loading profile pictures from external websites (CORS policy)
- The viewer automatically falls back to showing the first letter of the username in a colored circle
- This is a security feature by Instagram and cannot be bypassed in the browser
- Downloaded media (posts) will work fine, only external avatar URLs are blocked

### JSON Parse Error
- Make sure you selected a valid JSON file
- Check that the file isn't corrupted
- Try re-downloading your feed

### Filters Not Working
- Clear your search text
- Reset filter to "All Posts"
- Reload the page and try again

### Lightbox Issues
- Press ESC to close
- Refresh the page if buttons aren't responding
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled
